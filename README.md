* Each items on menu are accessible with keybaord (tab key) and has obvious visual focus indicator.
* Receiving focus menu item expose its states (expanded/collapsed) with screen reader.
* Receiving keyboard focus does not trigger the submenu to force user navigate top to all way down to get the next menu item.
* Interacting with menu item does not lose focus in most cased top of the page and remain on the same item.
* Each links on submenu has keybaord accessibility with obvious visual focus indicator.
### Terminology
